HOW TO COMPILE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The assignment has been created using the IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1.1 (Ultimate Edition) , Maven and Xerial sqlite database
JDBC module.
To compile the code, please open it in IntelliJ and adjust your module settings according to the below-mentioned
libraries. Once setup, you can click the green arrow at the top right hand side of the window or press (CTRL+R on Mac)
to run the program.

Because of the use of Maven libraries, we recommend running the program inside the IntelliJ IDE rather than compiling
from the command line. For this, we've provided the complete project folder structure.
